Project Background:

Education demographics is a complex and multifaceted field with various factors such as test scores, financial incomes, gender, race, ethnicity, school location, and parental education levels. This area of study has many problems that can make it difficult to obtain accurate and reliable data.

One of the main problems is the lack of standardization in testing and grading methods. Different schools and regions may have varying standards and practices, making it challenging to compare and evaluate student performance accurately.
Additionally, there is a significant socioeconomic divide in education, with students from low-income families often facing greater obstacles to academic success. This divide is further exacerbated by disparities in access to resources such as quality schools, experienced teachers, and extracurricular activities.

Gender and racial biases are also prevalent in education demographics, with certain groups experiencing discrimination and systemic barriers that hinder their academic performance and opportunities. Furthermore, there are gaps in representation and diversity in the teaching profession, which can affect student experiences and outcomes.
Overall, these challenges make it crucial for researchers and educators to approach education demographics with sensitivity and critical analysis, considering the multifaceted nature of the issues and the need for nuanced solutions.

Project Objective: 

In this project, we aim to compare and analyze the demographics and test scores of two different schools: a private wealthy school in Ft. Lauderdale and a small rural school in Georgia. The two schools represent different socioeconomic backgrounds, and we can expect to observe significant differences in their student populations. We will build a NN to predict the academic success of the students and determine if they will pass or fail their classes. 

The data will be cleaned to remove missing values, and extraneous outliers, and feature engineering will be applied to extract meaningful features. The cleaned data will be used to create a neural network using TensorFlow and Pytorch/PySpark to predict the outcome of the students.
Data Sets:
Kaggle Data Set - â€˜This dataset contains information on the performance of high school students in mathematics, including their grades and demographic information. The data was collected from three high schools in the United States. 
Gender: The gender of the student (male/female)
Race/ethnicity: The student's racial or ethnic background (Asian, African-American, Hispanic, etc.)
Parental level of education: The highest level of education attained by the student's parent(s) or guardian(s)
Lunch: Whether the student receives free or reduced-price lunch (yes/no)
Test preparation course: Whether the student completed a test preparation course (yes/no)
 Math score: The student's score on a standardized mathematics test
Reading score: The student's score on a standardized reading test
Writing score: The student's score on a standardized writing test
Rural School Georgia
Private School Florida - This dataset contains over 5000 lines of information on course grades for students in 9-12 Grade.
